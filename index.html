<h1 id="website">Website</h1>

<h2 id="wordpress">WordPress</h2>

<p>The website is built with WordPress, a very popular and <em>free</em> Content Management System (CMS), In fact, WordPress powers roughly 30% of all websites. If you haven&rsquo;t used it or would like to learn more I suggest you check out <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress.org</a> and go from there.</p>

<p>Staff members are highly encouraged to get familiar with using WordPress and posting information about their projects directly to the website. If you&rsquo;re worried about making a mistake and messing something up you shouldn&rsquo;t be, it&rsquo;s really a very simple process and if you are really concerned just ask for a limited account that will allow you to learn how things work. You can make the additions and changes you want and save them as a draft, then request that an admin take a look before <em>publishing</em> (ie. making changes permanent and visible on the internet).</p>

<p>Logging into the control panel is done by appending <code>/wp-admin</code> to the end of the default web url: <code>http://mattolesalmon.org</code>, so that it looks like this: <code>http://mattolesalmon.org/wp-admin</code>. There can be any number of users with varying permission levels to do pretty much as much or as little as you want. If you would like to obtain a <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> for the MSG&rsquo;s WordPress please talk to the website administrator, David Bux at <a href="mailto:bux@mattolesalmon.org">bux@mattolesalmon.org</a>. You can also reach out to the network administrator, Josh Madrone at <a href="mailto:josh@mattolesalmon.org">josh@mattolesalmon.org</a>.</p>

<p>The MSG utilizes the cloud hosted email solution known as Gsuite, formerly called Google Apps, which is a suite of software that includes, but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gmail - email</li>
<li>Docs – word processor intended as a replacement for Microsoft Word</li>
<li>Sheets – spreadsheet program intended as a replacement for Microsoft Excel</li>
<li>Slides – presentation software intended as a replacement for Microsoft PowerPoint</li>
<li>Drive – file sync and storage platform much like Dropbox or Microsoft OneDrive. Each user gets 15GB of free cloud storage with ability to sync their files between multiple computers and devices and share those files with anyone on the internet, but not <em>everyone</em> on the internet</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use your MSG username and password to log into any Google services, such as the ones mentioned above, plus others like YouTube and Google Groups. </p>

<h1 id="fileserver-quick-start-guide">FileServer Quick Start Guide</h1>

<h2 id="how-do-i-access-the-server">How do I access the server?</h2>

<p>There are a number of ways to connect to the server, each with their own set of pros and cons. For most users&rsquo; needs I would think that <strong>File Station</strong>, the built-in file manager that you can access from anywhere with your web browser, is probably the way to go. File Station provides a web-based file manager similar to Dropbox, Google Drive, or Microsoft OneDrive. You can drag and drop files to upload them and move them around. If you&rsquo;re looking to batch process lots of files at once, especially if to multiple locations on the server, you may want to use one of the other options which are covered in the following sections. Or maybe you just prefer to use something like <strong>FTP</strong> . The bottom line is that you should use what works best for you and for what task you are working on.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-use-file-station-to-manage-files">How to use File Station to Manage Files</h3>

<p>File Station is the file manager for QNAP NAS. No matter where you are, you can easily upload, download and manage files using a web browser. Navigate to the following url:</p>

<p><a href="https://files:mattolesalmon.org:9443/filestation">Login to File Station</a> using url below</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>https://files:mattolesalmon.org:9443/filestation
</pre></div>
<p><a href="https://msgfileserver.myqnapcloud.com:9443/filestation">This one works too</a></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>https://msgfileserver.myqnapcloud.com:9443/filestation
</pre></div>
<h3 id="how-to-mount-fileserver-as-network-volume-mac-only">How to Mount FileServer as Network Volume <em>Mac only</em></h3>

<p>Sometimes it may be more useful to mount the FileServer as a network shared volume, such as when copying large quantities of files to/from the server. Whether on a Mac or Windows PC, this will make the server appear as just another folder in Finder (Mac) or File Explorer (Windows) allowing drag ’n drop actions involving one or multiple files selected at once.</p>

<h4 id="windows">Windows</h4>

<ol>
<li><del>Open File Explorer and select This PC</del></li>
<li><del>Click the ‘Map network drive’ button in the ribbon menu at the top, then select “Map network drive.” (This is under the Computer tab and should open automatically when you go to This PC)</del>
3.~~ In the Drive list, select a drive letter. (Any available letter will do.), then ensure you have checked the box for “Connect using different credentials”~~</li>
<li><p><del>In the Folder box, type the address of the server using the following format:</del></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>~~\\msgfileserver.myqnapcloud.com\fileserver~~
</pre></div></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>Windows computers use the SMB/Samba protocol to connect to shared volumes which is not safe to impement over the Internet so this has been blocked. However, you can still connect in this way when using an encrypted VPN connection. The server supports OpenVPN and PPTP type VPN connections, including the one built-in to myQNAP Connect software. If you would like to set this up please send me a note.</p>

<hr>

<h4 id="mac">Mac</h4>

<ol>
<li>From Finder, go to <code>&quot;Go&quot; &gt; &quot;Connect to Server&quot;</code> to establish a connection with the QNAP NAS via SMB or AFP**. Alternatively, you can use the shortcut keys &ldquo;<code>Command + K</code>&rdquo; on your keyboard. </li>
<li><p>Enter the server address like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>afp://msgfileserver.myqnapcloud.com 
</pre></div>
<p>Enter your <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> when prompted, selecting “Log in as registered user…”.</p></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="ftp">FTP</h4>

<p>The File Transfer Protocol has been around for a long long time and provides a very stable, fast, and secure connection. <del>If anyone really prefers to connect using an FTP client, it can be done and I would be happy to assist if you send me a request via email. The server supports secure connections only using FTPS (FTP EnforcedSSL)</del> I will be posting updated instructions for using FTP over an encrypted SSL connection in the next couple of weeks. In short, use the server address (<code>msgfileserver.myqnapcloud.com</code>), standard port # <code>21</code>, mode = <code>passive</code>, must use <code>SSL</code>. Different ftp clients call this different things sometimes, but FTP with SSL, FTPS, FTPES, FTP Explicit Auth, are all examples. SFTP is <em>not</em> the same and will not work.</p>

<h3 id="usernames-and-passwords">Usernames and Passwords</h3>

<p>The username and password are the same regardless of which service or protocol is being used. <del>For staff*, the username is msg and the password is [ask administrator].</del> While the existing &ldquo;single user&rdquo; username <code>msg</code> will technically still work, please use your individual and unique username to connect to server. Your username is usually your full MSG email address (<code>somebody@mattolesalmon.org</code>). Passwords are managed by users. If you have forgotten your password or just need it reset, please send me a quick request.</p>

<p>Admin users will have an Appendix A attached to this document with relevant information.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-search-for-files">How to search for files</h2>

<p>File Station has built-in search abilities and usually provides a decent response time. Depending on the locatoin of files and the depth of folders, be prepared to wait for 5-20 seconds or more sometimes for your search results. </p>

<h3 id="qsirch-search-tool">Qsirch Search Tool</h3>

<p>If you can&rsquo;t find what you&rsquo;re looking for and need a more powerful tool, you can <strong>search for files with Qsirch</strong>, the Google like search tool developed by QNAP. You can access Qsirch from the QTS Desktop or with the <a href="https://msgfileserver.myqnapcloud.com:9443/qsirch">following url</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>https://msgfileserver.myqnapcloud.com:9443/qsirch
</pre></div>
<p>Mac users who have elected to mount the server as a network volume in their Finder can also use Apple&rsquo;s built-in search within Finder, as well as Spotlight, although if you haven&rsquo;t connected to the server before or recently then you will need to give Spotlight some time to index the server volume.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-a-info-for-admins">APPENDIX A - Info for Admins</h2>

<p>There are two volumes on the File Server, one called <code>FileServer</code> and one called <code>ADMIN</code>. You can think of each volume like a separate disk. Linda would probably be the best person to answer questions about this but here goes as I understand it.</p>

<p>Everything is stored on the volume named FileServer. This is where staff uploads reimbursement receipts, project photos, reports, etc.</p>

<p>The ADMIN volume, in part, is used to keep a copy of each Invoice and the accompanying files saved as a PDF. I believe this was something recommended as part of the audit in 2010. Linda uses the ADMIN volume for other financial related things also but you would have to talk to her to get details on that.</p>

<p>In the past there were 2 main users: admin, for gnome and linda, and msg, for staff and board. Those two users still exist, although I have been switching people over to individual user accounts whenever it makes sense, like someone asking for the password. Having individual users is better for a whole bunch of reasons, security being number one. It also makes it possible to audit changes, track who’s accessing files, when files are copied and by whom, which also makes it possible to revert changes made by mistake or accident.</p>

<p>To have your password reset, contact Josh. As a general rule of thumb, your username will be the same as your MSG email account. The password is managed in a different system though and is not connected to your email account.</p>

<h1 id="file-server-administration">File Server Administration</h1>

<p>Just a few quick notes about this because it&rsquo;s way too much information to type out here. The gist of it is that the file server and the network it is on is safe and secure. There are literally thousands of attempts to hack the server every day, many of which come from other countries like china and easter block old soviet countries. Some are US though too. The main security against this is monitoring the IP addresses and banning the associated ip address after x failed attempts in x minutes for x long. For SSH, the most dangerous and by far the most tried, this is 5 attempts in 5 mins = lifetime permanent ban. For FTP, AFP and SMB it is much more relaxed at 10 attempts in 15 mins = 1 day ban.</p>

<p>Periodic maintenance includes rotating log files, cleaning the filesystem, and anti-malware and virus scans. keeping software up-to-date is also important. Checking log files for suspicious activity is a must. The server sends all of its logs to my company&rsquo;s syslog server in the cloud over a secure connection.</p>

<h2 id="data-backups">Data Backups</h2>

<p>The RAID5 array provides some protection in the form of being able to survive the loss of a single hard disk and not lose any data. This is good but should not be thought of as a backup of any kind because it is not. There is only one copy of the data. Data is backed up in 2 additional places, so there are 3 copies of the data at all times. </p>

<p>The first backup is a local backup to an external hard drive that is attached to the server. This provides for fast and easy access to said data, but it also means that in the event of catastrophic failure, both the backup and original data will be lost, due to the fact that they share the same physical space (eg. thief would take everything and fire would destroy everything).</p>

<p>The 3rd and safest backup involves saving the entire contents of fileserver in the cloud. This is cost effective and provides the safest possible means for backup. We send nightly backups to AWS S3 buckets in the us-west-2 region (oregon), to save money over N. California. Data is stored there, in Standard Infrequent access, for 30 days. After 30 days it is archived to ultra low-cost Amazon Glacier storage, which provides excellent long-term storage for the absolute lowest price. The downside is that it may take several days to get the data back out in the event of needing to restore, but we&rsquo;re only talking about 1-3 days at most.</p>
